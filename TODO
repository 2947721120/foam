Standardize use of create/init in Views.  Should argument be optional value?

Finish moving to AbstractView Model.

fix uses of 'eid'
Replace getID() with .id
Replace element() with element
add isInitialized() to AbstractView

Model all views.
Rename View.get/setValue to 'value' property.
Add 'super' support.

Implement type support.
Support for generating default values (like 'label').
Add asserts to methods (including type-checking?).
Move extension methods out of context.js

The "FOAM Simulator" would actually make a nice view for
navigating a system's custom components.
It would show which components
had been overriden and could show which features have
enough model information to be generated.  Would be an
actual view into the Feature-Manager.  How to show for
sub-contexts?

Add 'Constants' to Model.  (Currently can be defined as methods.)


Fix up CView hierarchy.  Do we need an AbsstractCView that 
implements 'View' so individual CViews can be used without
a Canvas container.  Also, standardize position, size, rotation, 
etc.


MDAO

  with decorators for things like memoization, TTL, etc.
