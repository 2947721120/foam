Often, you'll be using one of FOAM's generic controllers, which can handle
navigation for you. In this tutorial, we'll do navigation by hand to demonstrate
more advanced templates, the `View` lifecycle, and other concepts.

We'll begin by expanding the `ControllerView` to make the decision of whether to
show us a single phone's page or the list. Expand it to look like this:

{% highlight js %}
CLASS({
  name: 'ControllerView',
  extendsModel: 'DetailView',
  templates: [
    function toHTML() {/*
      <% if ( window.location.hash ) {
        var view = PhoneDetailView.create({ model: Phone });
        this.addChild(view);

        this.data.dao.find(window.location.hash.substring(1), {
          put: function(phone) {
            view.data = phone;
          }
        });

        return view.toHTML();
      } else { %>
        Search: $$search
        Sort by: $$order
        <p>$$filteredDAO{className: 'phones', tagName: 'ul'}</p>
      <% } %>
    */}
  ],
  methods: {
    init: function() {
      this.SUPER();
      window.addEventListener('hashchange', function() {
        document.body.innerHTML = this.toHTML();
        this.initHTML();
      }.bind(this));
    }
  }
});
{% endhighlight %}

Note that our original `ControllerView` template is now the `else` branch, ie.
what will be shown when `window.location.hash` is empty.

- We're navigating by setting `window.location.hash` to the `id` of the phone we
  want to see.
- We can put real Javascript control structures inside `<%  %>` tags, and indeed
  the `if` branch is written entirely in Javascript.
- In that first branch, we create a `PhoneDetailView`, which we'll define
  shortly. We tell it what `model` it should be the view for, but not what
  object is currently being viewed.
- All views have `addChild`, which adds another view to a list of child views.
  The default `initHTML` (see below) will call `initHTML()` on all the child
  views recursively.
- We look up the phone in the master `dao`, not the filtered one.
  `find(id, sink)` will locate a single item by its ID.
    - The `id` of the phone we want to find is the hash, with the leading `#`
      chopped off.
    - We provide a custom `sink`, which is just a Javascript object with a `put`
      function. `put` will be called, if defined, when a DAO finds an object
      matching a query.
    - When the phone is found, the DAO will call our sink's `put` function with
      the `Phone` object. Our `put` will set `view.data` to the phone, and the
      `PhoneDetailView` will automatically update itself to display this new
      data.
- We also add an `init` method. This is similar to a constructor and is called
  during `ControllerView.create()`. It is very important to call `this.SUPER()`
  first thing in any custom `init` we write, since the parent classes do several
  important things in `init`.
- Our `init` adds a listener to the `hashchange` event, which will re-render the
  template into the page. DOM templates have a two-step lifecycle:
    - `toHTML()` is the main template function. It returns a string which gets
      added to the DOM.
    - `initHTML()` needs to run after everything is added to the DOM. It hooks
      up any listeners, calls `initHTML` recursively on children, and so on. You
      generally won't need to write custom `initHTML` methods.


Now we need to define `PhoneDetailView`. As we did before, let's simply define
it as an empty subclass of `DetailView`:

{% highlight js %}
CLASS({
  name: 'PhoneDetailView',
  extendsModel: 'DetailView'
});
{% endhighlight %}

That will be enough to let us reload the page and see it working, though it will
be ugly as before.

Try it! Click on a phone in the catalog, and you will switch to its detail view.
Use your browser's Back button, and you're back at the catalog.
