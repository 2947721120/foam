How to run tests?
=================
The unit tests here uses node.js and minijasminenode for non-UI DAO tests.
To run the unit tests locally, you need to install node.js and minijasminenode.

Please refer to http://nodejs.org regarding how to install node.js.

For Ubuntu users, quick cheat sheet:

sudo apt-get install nodejs
sudo npm install -g minijasminenode

(If you don't want to install node modules globally, you must install them under
this directory so that node can find them.)

To run the tests, simply run

node test_loader.js <test cases to run>

The test cases are named *_spec.js to comply to Jasmine convention.


How to write tests?
===================
The test bots are hosted by Google and they'll run the nodejs-based unit tests.
The bots run nodejs 0.8.14 and minijasminenode 0.2.5 (jasmine 1.3.1).

Currently only nodejs built-in modules and minijasminenode are supported. Please
use only these modules to make the unit tests bot friendly, thank you!
