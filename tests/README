The unit tests here uses node.js and minijasminenode for non-UI DAO tests.
Please refer to http://nodejs.org regarding how to install node.js.

For Ubuntu users, quick cheat sheet:

sudo apt-get install nodejs
sudo npm install -g minijasminenode

(If you don't want to install node modules globally, you must install them under
this directory so that node can find them.)

To run the tests, simply run

node test_loader.js <test cases to run>

The test cases are named *_spec.js to comply to Jasmine testing framework
convention.
